            <h2>Job Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>As a student, I haven't really had much time to do, well, much! I've worked as a software engineer for a few months for an internship at pet republic. Nothing else has come from that though.</p>

        <section class="hobbies">
            <h2>Hobbies and Special Interests</h2>
            <p>I'm really, REALLY big on games! I've played a decent bit and (probably) am going to continue to play a lot! I have a collection spanning around 1400 games so far, and I've played an average of 300~ games a year at this point! I also host Dungeons and Dragons, spend time on game dev, and am trying to pick up both drawing and music!</p>

            <h2>Reasons for Pursuing This Degree</h2>
            <p>I've been a big fan of computers ever since I was little. Something about them just kinda comforts me?</p>

        <section class="course">
            <h2>Reasons for Taking This Course</h2>
            <p>Well, it opens senior design, so there's that. That being said, I'm also a big fan of how on hands it seems? I like the idea and the vibe of the class so far!</p>

            <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
            <p>It took me so long to make this because of how sick I was the moment the first week was finished!</p>
